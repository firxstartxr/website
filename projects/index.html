            <p>Decided to explore the Secure Boot possibilites inside a custom compiled Linux kernel. It was a fun experience compiling your own Linux
            kernel and signing it with your own keys.</p>

            <p>I volunteered to help make this project during my internship at Piros. It was supposed to help the company make a presentation to one of the 
            clients. My job was to figure out how to horizontally scale a nginx deployment and find the correct metrics. I learned a lot about Openshift, Keda and
            Prometheus and also helped the team to achieve their goal.</p>
